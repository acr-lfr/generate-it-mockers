# Generate-It-Mockers

Speed up development time by reducing the donkey work, Generate-It is an open-sourced tool from [https://www.acrontum.com](https://www.acrontum.com)

This package is used by generate-it to mock the domain layer generated by templates.

## Using this tool

Simply pass a valid JSON Schema object (derived from swagger/openapi) and it will generate random mocked data.

## Why use this tool

When you design your API first with swagger/openapi, then you will want your backend and frontend team to start working right away without 1 team having to wait for the other.

For this to happen, your API should be able to return mocked data based on the API, generate-it... this tool will handle the rest.
